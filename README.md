# TSP - The Seattle Pipeline for Deep Learning Methods for Cell and Tissue Imaging Analysis

## Pipeline steps

Pre-processing

- background reduction and optimizing brightness using the ZKW DataWizard application
- eliminating/blacking out false or artificial fluorescence signals generated by debris introduced into the chip chamber during the multiple staining cycles using Fiji (ImageJ)
- alignment using tsp
- cropping

Analysis

- cell segmentation
- compute distance to boundary
- compute region membership
- multistaining analysis
- statistical analysis


## Image alignment

> python -m tsp alignimages --ref_image xx  --image2 xx 

Optional input:

- --l Channels. If the images are grayscale, the argument is not needed. If the images are RBG, the argument is used to extract the channels of interest from the two images: 1 R, 2 G, 3 B, e.g. [2,2]

Output 

- A new image file named _aligned.png will be saved.

 
## Cell segmentation with cellpose 
> python -m tsp runcellpose --f '*.png' --l [0,0]  --model cytotrain7

Required input:
- --f is required and tells the program which image files to segment. The quotes around file name pattern are required, because otherwise it will be expanded by shell

- --l A list of 2 numbers indicating [cytoplasm channel, nucleus channel]. Each value can be 0, 1 (red), 2 (green), and 3 (blue)
For the cytoplasm channel, 0 means grayscale; for the nucleus channel, 0 means no nuclei. 
E.g. [3,0] that means cytoplasm signal is in the blue channel and no nuclei; [0,0] means cytoplasm is taken from a grayscale image and no nuclei.

- --model Cellpose model to use, including cyto and cytotrain7. cyto is the Cellpose default, cytotrain7 is the model from Sunwoo et al.


Optional input:
- --saveimgwithmasks Without this option, _masks.png is a grayscale image with masks outlines. With this option, the intensities are also present in this file

- --saveflow If present, .npy file containing flow, diam and masks will be saved.

- --saveroi If present, mask outline roi files will be saved.

- --s If present, additional image files will be saved.

- --flow Flow threshold. Larger values => more masks. This may be the most important parameter to adjust at inference. Default 0.4.  

- --cellprob Cell probability threshold. Smaller values => larger and fewer masks, fewer because masks they are close start to merge. Default 0. 

- --d Cell diameter. Default 0. 

- --normalize100 If present, normalize image from min to max instead of 1 to 99 percentiles. This helps when there are few cells in the image.

- --min_size Post-processing parameter, min_size, is changed from 15 (default) to the specified value. If a cell consists of the number of pixels less than min_size, the cell is removed. 

- --min_avgintensity Post-processing parameter, min_average_intensity, is changed from 0 (default) to the specified value. If an average intensity of pixels in a cell is less than min_average_intensity, the cell is removed. 

- --min_totalintensity Post-processing parameter, min_total_intensity, is changed from 0 (default) to the specified value. If the total intensity of pixels in a cell is less than min_total_intensity, the cell is removed. 


Output 

- cellpose_counts_timestr.txt: number of predicted masks for each image 

- _masks.csv: a text file containing info about the size of each predicted mask and x-y coordinate of center pixel of each predicted mask  

- _masks.png: If --saveimgwithmasks is present, the original image with masks overlaid; otherwise, a grayscale image with masks outlines

- _masks_fill.png (with -s): a grayscale file containing the solid fill of the predicted cell masks 

- _masks_point.png (with -s): an RGB file with mask centers plotted in the R channel and image copied from input if image.ndim is 3 or image in the G and B channels if image.ndim is 2

- _masks_text.png (with -s):  an RGB file with mask indices plotted in the R channel and image copied from input if image.ndim is 3 or image in the G and B channels if image.ndim is 2

- _seg.npy (with -saveflow): cellpose output file containing overall info about predicted masks and parameters used in prediction. This file can be huge.

- _cp_outlines.txt (with -saveroi): a text file that can be converted to roi by ImageJ if imagej_roi_converter.py from Cellpose is run as a macro after opening image file



## Cell phenotyping 
> python -m tsp cellphenotyping --f [file1.png,file2.png,file3.png] --m [Mask,Mask] --c [0.5,0.5] --p [True,False] --n [marker2,marker3] 

The command above looks for marker1+marker2+marker3- cells.  Let K be the number of markers. 

Required input:
- --f List of K file names. In this example, for the first file, the program expects to find both file1.png and file1_seg.npy. For the following files, e.g. file2.png, the program expects to find the mask file (_seg.npy) if the method is Mask and the image file otherwise. 

- --m List of K-1 values from Mask, Intensity_avg_pos, Intensity_avg_all, or Intensity_total. Methods for finding multistained cells. Under mask, overlap between A and B is computed for individual B cells, not all B cells.

- --c List of K-1 cutoff values for deciding if markers are present.

- --p List of K-1 values from True or False. Marker is required to be present if True and abscent if False.

- --n List of K-1 names for markers (first marker excluded). 

Optional input:

- --l List of K-1 channels. If the images are grayscale, the argument is not needed. If the images are RBG, the argument is used to extract the channels of interest from the two images: 1 R, 2 G, 3 B, e.g. [2,2]

- --s If present, additional image files will be saved.

- --r If present, two additional result files will be saved for the last stage: 1) a cellpose output file named _seg.npz that contains information of masks, outlines, flows, and a cell diameter, 2) a simple text file named _masks.csv that contains the sizes and the x and y coordinates for each mask. 

Output 

- _counts_multistain.txt: cell counts, one row for each additional marker

- _counts_lastcutoff.txt: cell counts for a series of cutoffs for the last marker

- _masks.csv: a text file containing info about the size of each predicted mask and x-y coordinate of center pixel of each predicted mask, last marker only

- _masks.png: K grayscale files with mask outlines 

- _masks_fill.png (with -s): K grayscale files with masks as filled shapes

<!--- - _point.png (with -s): K grayscale files with each mask drawn as a point. --->

- _seg.npz (with -r): cellpose output file containing overall info about image and masks, last marker only




## Intensity statistics 

> python -m tsp intensityanalysis --maskfile xx_seg.npy  --f '*.png'  

Load masks in xx_seg.npy and measures the intensities of each markers in the list of image files. 

Required input

- --maskfile A _seg.npy file containing the mask info.

- --f List of file names matching the pattern.

Optional iput

- --l An integer: 1 (red), 2 (green), and 3 (blue). Not required if image files are grayscale.

Output 
- _MFI.csv: contains the x-y coordinates and MFI for each mask 



## Compute distance from cell center to a boundary polyline

Appends shortest distance from cell centers to boundary lines as new columns and save as a new _d2b.csv file.

> python -m tsp dist2boundary --cells masks.csv  --boundaryroi boundary.roi  --saveas col_name

- --cells: a csv file containing the cell center coordinates

- --boundaryroi: roi files defining the boundary, can be either [file1.roi,file2.roi] or 'file*.roi'




## Compute region membership

Appends region membership as new columns and save as a new _regmem.csv file.

> python -m tsp regionmembership --cells masks.csv  --regionroi [region1.roi,region2.roi]

- --cells: a csv file containing the cell center coordinates

- --boundaryroi: roi files defining the boundary, can be either [file1.roi,file2.roi] or 'file*.roi'

 

## Working with masks

To convert roi files into mask png files
> python -m tsp roifiles2mask --roifolder eg1 --height 1040 --width 1392 
 
where roifolder is the path to the folder containing the unzipped roi files, height and width are the dimension of the image. The program creates two png files, one mask file and one mask outline file. 

To unzip, e.g.

> unzip CF_Les_Pos7_CD3+CD8+_RoiSet_865.zip -d CF_Les_Pos7_CD3+CD8+_RoiSet_865 

To compare two mask files to get AP
> python -m tsp AP --mask1 testmasks/M872956_JML_Position10_CD3_test_masks.png --mask2  testmasks/M872956_JML_Position10_CD3_test_masks.png 
> 
> python -m tsp AP --mask1 M926910_Position1_CD45+CD56+_seg.npz --mask2 M926910_Position1_CD45+CD56+CD3-CD271-_seg.npz 

To compare two folders of masks
> python -m tsp checkprediction --metric   --predfolder   --gtfolder   --min_size

To add mask1 in red, mask2 in green (optional), and overlap in yellow, all on top of images
> python -m tsp overlaymasks

To add mask2 in green and highlight tp (based on comparing with mask1) in yellow, on top of images
> python -m tsp colortp

To make outlines from masks
> python -m tsp mask2outline --f '*.png'
